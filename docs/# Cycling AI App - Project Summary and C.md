# Cycling AI App - Project Summary and Current State

## Project Overview
Building a cycling app focused on AI-powered route recommendations and predictive maintenance, differentiating from Strava by offering intelligent route building considering past rides, weather, time of day, and traffic, plus sophisticated maintenance prediction based on ride history and conditions.

## Current Development Status: ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE
**File Upload and Data Processing System**

### What We've Built
1. **React Application Foundation**
   - Create React App setup with proper development environment
   - Professional UI with gradient design
   - Component-based architecture

2. **Multi-Format Data Processing**
   - GPX file parsing (GPS Exchange Format)
   - TCX file parsing (Training Center XML with power/HR data)
   - CSV file parsing (exported data)
   - Native browser XML parsing (using DOMParser, not xml2js)

3. **Data Standardization Pipeline**
   - Consistent internal data structure regardless of source format
   - Comprehensive ride metrics calculation (distance, elevation, duration, averages)
   - Error handling and file validation

4. **User Interface**
   - Drag-and-drop file upload
   - Real-time processing feedback
   - Professional data display with ride summaries
   - Track point preview functionality

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18+** with functional components and hooks
- **Native browser APIs** (DOMParser for XML, FileReader for file handling)
- **Papaparse** for CSV processing
- **CSS3** with modern styling (gradients, grid, flexbox)

### Key Technical Decisions Made
1. **Browser-native XML parsing** instead of xml2js (avoided Node.js polyfill issues)
2. **Component-based architecture** for scalability
3. **Standardized data format** for AI algorithm compatibility
4. **Local state management** using React hooks (useState)

### Dependencies
- **papaparse**: CSV parsing with intelligent type detection
- **React**: UI framework
- No other external dependencies (uses browser-native APIs)

## Data Structure Design
```javascript
{
  metadata: {
    filename: "morning_ride.gpx",
    type: "gpx",
    uploadedAt: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    name: "Route Name"
  },
  trackPoints: [
    {
      latitude: 40.7128,
      longitude: -74.0060,
      elevation: 10.5,
      timestamp: "2025-01-15T08:00:00Z",
      heartRate: 145,      // null if not available
      power: 250,          // null if not available
      cadence: 90          // null if not available
    }
    // ... more track points
  ],
  summary: {
    distance: 25.6,           // km
    duration: 3600,           // seconds
    elevationGain: 450,       // meters
    averagePower: 220,        // watts (null if no power data)
    averageHeartRate: 155,    // bpm (null if no HR data)
    maxElevation: 850,        // meters
    minElevation: 400,        // meters
    pointCount: 1200          // number of GPS points
  }
}
```

## Current Capabilities
- ✅ Upload and parse GPX files (standard GPS tracks)
- ✅ Upload and parse TCX files (Garmin training files with sensor data)
- ✅ Upload and parse CSV files (exported cycling data)
- ✅ Calculate distance using Haversine formula
- ✅ Calculate elevation gain and extremes
- ✅ Calculate duration from timestamps
- ✅ Calculate average power and heart rate (when available)
- ✅ Display comprehensive ride summaries
- ✅ Error handling for invalid files
- ✅ Professional, responsive UI

## Development Environment
- **OS**: Windows 11 with WSL + Linux Chromebook
- **Tools**: VS Code, Node.js (via nvm), Git
- **Workflow**: Hot reloading development server
- **Testing**: Manual testing with real cycling data files

## Next Phase Options (For New Chat)
1. **Data Persistence** (Recommended next)
   - Local storage for multiple rides
   - Ride history dashboard
   - Basic analytics on historical data

2. **Route Visualization**
   - Map integration for route display
   - Elevation profile charts
   - Ride comparison visualizations

3. **Basic AI Features**
   - Pattern recognition in ride data
   - Simple route recommendations
   - Preference learning algorithms

4. **Maintenance Tracking**
   - Component tracking interface
   - Basic wear calculations
   - Maintenance scheduling

## Key Learning Outcomes
- React functional components and hooks
- File handling in browser environments
- XML parsing with native browser APIs
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design
- Error handling and user experience design
- Professional development workflow setup

## Development Time Investment
- Approximately 8-10 hours of focused development
- Environment setup: ~2 hours
- Component development: ~4 hours
- Styling and UX: ~2 hours
- Debugging and refinement: ~2 hours

## Ready for Next Phase
The foundation is solid and ready for building advanced features. All core data processing works reliably with real cycling files, and the component architecture supports adding new features without refactoring existing code.
